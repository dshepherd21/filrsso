Filr Additional Pages for SSO

The files here are based on Python CGI Scripts. For this to work you will need an Apache2 instance with a configured CGI instance. The default is cgi-bin, so by default place the files there.

The auth.conf file holds the Filr Server you will be talking to plus the expiration time for the secure cookie. To start the code once installed use .. https://server/cgi-bin/cookie.py
